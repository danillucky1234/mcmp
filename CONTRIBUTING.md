# Contributing to this project  

## Getting started

Before you begin:
- Be sure to check if [issue exists](https://github.com/danillucky1234/mcmp/issues) already and see if the issue is assigned to anyone or not.  
- If no one is assigned you can start working on the issue.  
- Be sure to leave a comment saying that you are working on the issue.  

### Issue already assigned to someone? Ask before starting  
If the issue is already assigned to someone, leave a comment asking how you can contribute. Please do not start working on your own without confirmation.  

### Don't see your issue? Open one  
If you spot something new, open an [issue](https://github.com/danillucky1234/mcmp/issues/new/choose). We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.  

### Ready to make a change? Fork the repo  
[Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.  
### Open a pull request  
When you're done making changes and you'd like to propose them for review, open your PR (pull request). You can use the GitHub user interface for some small changes, like fixing a typo or updating a readme. You can also fork the repo and then clone it locally, to view changes and run your tests on your machine.  

### Submit your PR & get it reviewed  
- Once you submit your PR, others from the Docs community will review it with you. The first thing you're going to want to do is a <u>self review</u>.  
- After that, we may have questions, check back on your PR to keep up with the conversation.  
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.  

### Your PR is merged!
Congratulations! The whole community thanks you. :sparkles:
